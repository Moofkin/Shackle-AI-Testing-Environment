Shackle is a cooperative puzzle horror game being developed by:
   Hayden Platt https://github.com/misterplatt
   Dara Diba https://github.com/ddiba
   Ryan Connors https://github.com/ConnorsRM
   and Lauren Cunningham (myself) https://github.com/Moofkin
for Windows and Mac using the Occulus Rift.

This game will feature an AI, developed by myself, that will double as
a dynamic difficulty adjustment system for the game.

This game will be created using Unity 3D.

This project will contain the AI's innards as I create it, as well as
a testing environment designed to observe its behaviors.
